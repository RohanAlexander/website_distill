# Overview

The Toronto Data Workshop (TDW) was co-founded by [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/) and [Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/) to bring together researchers from many academic disciplines and industry to collectively consider, collate, share, and disseminate best practices in the critical initial steps in a data science project: data collection; data cleaning; and data storage, retrieval, dissemination, and protection.

Since Fall 2019, our multidisciplinary workshop has brought together academic and industry participants to share what we do in these crucial, yet little discussed, stages of working with data and share data best practices. We meet weekly for an hour and aim to have a roughly even split of participants from academia and industry over the course of each term. Participants come from many fields, including financial tech, digital humanities, and healthcare information, among others. 

Anyone is welcome to attend - you don't need to be affiliated with the university. 

We thank Wendy Duff and the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto, for support for this workshop.


# Location and time

In the Summer Term we will meet Thursdays at 4-5pm (Toronto time) via Zoom. For details and an invitation to attend please [get in touch](mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca).
