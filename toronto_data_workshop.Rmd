**16 June 2020: We have announced three $1,000 research stipends. Please visit this [page](https://rohanalexander.com/toronto_data_workshop-stipends.html) for more information**


# Overview

The Toronto Data Workshop (TDW) brings together researchers from many academic disciplines and industry to collectively consider, collate, share, and disseminate best practices in the critical initial steps in a data science project: data collection; data cleaning; and data storage, retrieval, dissemination, and protection.

The current organising committee is: Faria Khandaker, Kelly Lyons, and Rohan Alexander.

Since Fall 2019, our multidisciplinary workshop has brought together academic and industry participants to share what we do in these crucial, yet little discussed, stages of working with data and share data best practices. We meet weekly for an hour and aim to have a roughly even split of participants from academia and industry over the course of each term. Participants come from many fields, including financial tech, digital humanities, and healthcare information, among others. 

Anyone is welcome to attend - you don't need to be affiliated with the university. 

We thank Dean Wendy Duff and the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto, for support for this workshop.


# Location and time

In the Summer Term we will meet Thursdays at 4-5pm (Toronto time) via Zoom. For details and an invitation to attend please [get in touch](mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca).

Shiro will bring together best practices for organizing data and code in the social sciences that experts have proposed with some of his own experience. He will propose a project-oriented workflow that adopts a minimal and consistent file organization structure within a single project, using RStudio Projects and GitHub. He will then discuss how to organize multiple projects that share common components, and propose the use of custom R packages to share code and Dataverse to share large datasets. He will use some of his own projects involving the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), one of the largest political surveys of American Politics, as a demonstration.
