description: |
  INF2010 is post-graduate level reading course at the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto.
---

The purpose of this reading course to be held in Winter 2021 is to develop students who can:

- engage in thoughtful, ethical, critique of data science, its antecedents, current state, and likely evolution; and 
- work productively to implement existing data science methods, as well as contribute to the creation of novel methods or applications.

Each week students will read relevant papers and books, engage with them through discussion with each other and the instructor, learn related technical skills, and bring this together through on-going assessment. All students are expected to be prepared for each week's discussion through completing the readings and technical requirements. A specific student will act as the lead for each week.
