Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan Alexander.

I am an Assistant Professor in [Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/profile/rohan-alexander/) and [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/rohan-alexander) (jointly-appointed) at the University of Toronto, Canada. 

My [academic interests](https://rohanalexander.com/academic.html) are multidisciplinary but fall at the intersection of information and statistical science. I use quantitative methods to explore human-centered questions with an emphasis on data concerns. I am interested in not only statistical science, that is, drawing quantitative inferences from real-world data, but also in information science, through my emphasis on all aspects of obtaining, preparing, storing, and sharing data.

My research typically involves first constructing new datasets in a reproducible way, drawing on methods including digitization, record matching, survey collection, and web-scraping. After constructing datasets I then typically use quantitative methods to analyse the large amounts of information contained in them, drawing on techniques from natural language processing, machine learning, and Bayesian methods, as appropriate. As my work is focused on individuals, issues of privacy and consent are of critical importance, and exist within my broader research interests in the intersection of data and ethics. Additionally, I develop open science best practises that help enhance reproducibility and replicability, as well as understanding.

My work is arranged around three tranches:

- Multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP).
- Natural language processing (NLP).
- Workflow analysis.


I co-founded the [Toronto Data Workshop](https://rohanalexander.com/toronto_data_workshop.html),  which is more fun than it sounds; please [get in touch](mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca) if you'd like to attend or present!

<!-- Based on my academic research I run a political poll in Australia: [Petit Poll](https://petitpoll.com). This combines non-representative polling data that we gather ourselves with a hierarchical Bayesian model to cheaply deliver meaningful Australian political polling. -->

Finally, I probably spend too much money on books, and certainly too much time at libraries. You can see some of the books that I recommend [here](https://rohanalexander.com/bookshelf.html). If you have any book recommendations of your own, I've love to hear them.
