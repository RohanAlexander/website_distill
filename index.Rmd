Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan Alexander.

**16 June 2020: Kelly Lyons and I have announced three $1,000 research stipends. Please visit this [page](https://rohanalexander.com/toronto_data_workshop-stipends.html) for more information.**

I am a post-doc at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto, Canada. 

My [academic research](https://rohanalexander.com/academic.html) answers questions in social sciences, such as: are our politicians actually representing us, do elections matter, and how can we make political polling better. To do this I build, clean, maintain, and share datasets in a reproducible way, and then use quantitative methods, such as text analysis, machine learning, and Bayesian hierarchical models, to analyse them.

I co-founded the [Toronto Data Workshop](https://rohanalexander.com/toronto_data_workshop.html),  which is more fun than it sounds; please [get in touch](mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca) if you'd like to attend or present!

<!-- Based on my academic research I run a political poll in Australia: [Petit Poll](https://petitpoll.com). This combines non-representative polling data that we gather ourselves with a hierarchical Bayesian model to cheaply deliver meaningful Australian political polling. -->

Finally, I probably spend too much money on books, and certainly too much time at libraries. You can see some of the books that I recommend [here](https://rohanalexander.com/bookshelf.html). If you have any book recommendations of your own, I've love to hear them.
