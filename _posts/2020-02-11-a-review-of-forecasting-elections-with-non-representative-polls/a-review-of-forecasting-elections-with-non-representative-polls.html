<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>‘Forecasting elections with non-representative polls’ by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasweiwang/">Wei Wang</a>, <a href="https://researchdmr.com/">David Rothschild</a>, <a href="https://5harad.com/">Sharad Goel</a>, and <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/">Andrew Gelman</a>, published in 2015 in the <em>International Journal of Forecasting</em>, is a wonderful paper that should be more widely read, studied, and cited.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It touches on many aspects from across social sciences and applied statistics, allowing readers from a variety of backgrounds a chance to better understand multi-level regression with post-stratification (MRP), and how they might contribute to its development or apply it in their own contexts. The paper clearly illustrates the power of MRP and motivates its use more widely, but is held back by not being reproducible and some unusual choices around datasets.</p>
<p>In the paper the authors use a non-representative sample of voting intention in the 2012 US presidential election from the Xbox platform, which enables people to play video games against each other online. They then combine this sample with data from exit polls, as well as a Bayesian hierarchical model, to provide estimates that are very similar to those produced from representative samples.</p>
<p>The key contributions of the paper include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Showing how a ‘non-traditional’ dataset can still yield meaningful results.</li>
<li>Translating daily estimates of opinion into what actually determines the election: electoral college votes.</li>
<li>Illustrating the potential for MRP in other areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Key weaknesses of the paper include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a lack of reproducibility, and even a lack of transparency in some aspects;</li>
<li>a difficult-to-justify choice of dataset for post-stratification;</li>
<li>a lack of clarity around the propagation of uncertainty; and</li>
<li>an inconsistent definition of what a good MRP model produces.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the remainder of this review I will summarise the key aspects of the paper, attempting to link them to subsequent research where appropriate, and discussing the paper’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as raising questions that are unresolved in my mind. Based on Google Scholar, as of 11 February 2020, the paper has ‘only’ been cited around 250 times. It deserves to be much more widely read as it is a straight-forward paper that clearly illustrates the power of MRP, without hiding the potential issues.</p>

<p>The paper begins with a detailed description of the role of representative sampling in modern opinion polling. It clearly illustrates why representative sampling become important, following the <em>Literary Digest</em> error during the 1936 US presidential election between Landon and Roosevelt. It does this with reference to two papers, both published in <em>Public Opinion Quarterly</em> albeit with a gap of more than 50 years, that are very interesting in their own right: Gosnell (1937) and Squire (1988) (Figure <a href="#fig:bothpapers">2</a>).</p>

<p>These first few paragraphs may prompt some readers to think about the role of representative sampling in their own areas. The authors clearly establish the paper as aimed at a general audience,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> rather than solely <del>Bayesian cult members</del>, <del>quantitative absolutionists</del>, <del>math wunderkinds<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></del>, <del>Stan stans<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></del> those who are already convinced of the power of MRP. The authors then give two reasons why the primacy of representative sampling may not now be absolute:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Non-response rates are increasing for a variety of reasons including a reluctance to answer phone surveys and increased screening. The effect is possible concern around selection, but even if this selection issue does not arise, lower response rates require more post-sampling adjustment.</li>
<li>Online surveys mean large, non-representative, samples are much cheaper to collect.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the basis of this the authors suggest MRP as an alternative and proceed to discuss their sample and their post-stratification dataset.</p>
<h1 id="data">Data</h1>
<p>At a minimum MRP requires two datasets. The first is the sample that is of interest, and the second is a dataset by which to adjust for some of that sample’s bias. This paper uses data from a biased, but large, sample of Xbox users about their voting intention in the 2012 US presidential election, and uses a poststratification dataset from exit polls.</p>
<h3 id="survey-data">Survey data</h3>
<p>Key facts about the survey data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data from an opt-in poll which was available on the Xbox gaming platform during the 45 days preceding the 2012 US presidential election.</li>
<li>Each day there were three to five questions, including voter intention: ‘If the election were held today, who would you vote for?’.</li>
<li>Respondents were allowed to answer at most once per day.</li>
<li>First-time respondents were asked to provide information about themselves, including their sex, race, age, education, state, party ID, political ideology, and who they voted for in the 2008 presidential election. (That demographic data was collected before a respondent answered a poll to try to limit the amount of people switching their demographics to be in line with their intention, although it is difficult to adjust for the inverse, and increasingly respondents seem to be responding as pundits.)</li>
<li>There were 750,148 responses, 345,858 unique respondents, and over 30,000 unique respondents who completed five or more polls.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The dataset is highly skewed (Figure <a href="#fig:figone">3</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>18-to-29-year-olds comprise 65 per cent of the Xbox dataset, compared to 19 per cent in the exit poll.</li>
<li>Men make up 93 per cent of the Xbox sample but only 47 per cent of the electorate.</li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Age and sex are known to be strongly correlated with voting preferences, and this shows up in the raw data (Figure <a href="#fig:figtwo">4</a>).</p>

The dotted blue line indicates a consensus average of traditional polls (the daily aggregated polling results from Pollster.com), the horizontal dashed line at 52% indicates the actual two-party vote share obtained by Barack Obama, and the vertical dotted lines give the dates of the three presidential debates.'" width="1412" />

</p>

<p>There are considerable changes over time, for instance a decrease in support for Obama after the first debate (Figure <a href="#fig:figtwo">4</a>).</p>
<h3 id="post-stratification-data">Post-stratification data</h3>
<p>The survey is biased, but the question at the heart of MRP is whether it can be salvaged.</p>
<p>In order to adjust for known bias in the sample we need a dataset that we would like our dataset to ‘mimic’. This is done by constructing ‘cells’ which are defined by a combination of all of the variables (say economic, demographic, and geographic features). For instance if we were interested in explaining vote share on the basis of age-group and sex, then we would need to know the number of 18-29-year-old males, the numbers of 18-29-year-old females, the number of 30-45-year-old males, and so on. We then apply a model trained on the survey to these ‘corrected’ proportions. Hence each additional variable adds considerably to what is needed from the post-stratification dataset.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Once those cells are constructed, then the model trained on the sample is applied to each cell to generate an estimate for each cell. For instance, we might be interested in the proportion of 18-29-year-old males who would vote for Obama. Those cells can then be aggregated based on their relative-weight in the post-stratification dataset. For instance, if 18-29-year-old males make up 10 per cent of the population then their support for Obama would be weighted to 10 per cent.</p>
<p>This section of the paper is especially compelling. It draws on a variety of important issues including sampling and uncertainty, to motivate the use of a hierarchical model. The specific issue in the minds of many readers who may be new to MRP but are used to analysing surveys is that the above post-stratification process could be done with weights. This requires assuming that within each cell the sampling is un-biased. That implies a need for fine cells. But in practice especially fine cells are likely to have small populations, and so small differences will have large effects. Here we can think of the kidney cancer counties example where the clusters of the high and low countries tend to be right next to each other, because a handful of cases in a small area has a big effect. We can also think of <a href="https://www.monicaalexander.com/">Monica Alexander’s</a> shrinking California example (Figure <a href="#fig:figcali">5</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>Hence, the need for a hierarchical model!<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The authors mention a variety of MRP papers going back to 2004.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The authors use a large number of variables to generate the cells by:</p>
<ul>
<li>sex (2 categories);</li>
<li>race (4 categories);</li>
<li>age-group (4 categories);</li>
<li>education (4 categories);</li>
<li>state (51 categories);</li>
<li>party ID (3 categories);</li>
<li>ideology (3 categories); and</li>
<li>2008 vote (3 categories).</li>
</ul>
<p>As such they have <span class="math inline">\(2\times4\times4\times4\times51\times3\times3\times3 = 176,256\)</span> cells. O.M.G. The authors provide some justification for the inclusion of each of these variables, but there was scope for more given the importance of this aspect within an MRP analysis.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the usual go-to survey in the US in terms of post-stratification data. But the authors turn away from the CPS because ‘the CPS is missing some key poststratification variables, such as party identification.’<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Instead they use exit poll data from the 2008 presidential election.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exit polls are conducted outside voting stations on election day, and record the choices of exiting voters; they are generally used by researchers and news media to analyze the demographic breakdown of the vote (after a post-election adjustment that aligns the weighted responses to the reported state-by-state election results).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exit poll that they use is made up of 101,638 respondents.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The authors describe how this disadvantages their analysis as they have to use data that is four years out of date (it wouldn’t be appropriate to use 2012 exit polls to forecast the 2012 election!).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="model">Model</h1>
<p>Given the nature of the US electorate, they use a nested modelling approach: the first models whether a respondent is likely to vote for one of Obama or Romney given various information such as state, education, sex, etc:<sup>[Romney! Wow! Remember the good old days when it was the fact that the Republican candidate was going to go out of his way to appoint lots of women to positions of power was something that was held against him.]</sup>[The point was raised during discussion that to a certain extent it’s not clear why they bother with this two-level approach. How large could the number of non-major party voters be? In any case, it introduces a lot, and I’m not sure the trade-off is there.] <span class="math display">\[
Pr\left(Y_i\in\{\mbox{Obama, Romney}\}\right) =\\
\mbox{logit}^{-1}\left(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1(\mbox{state last vote share}) 
+ \\
\alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{state}} + \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{edu}} + \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{sex}} + \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{age}}+ \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{race}}+ \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{party ID}}+\\ \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{ideology}}+ \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{last vote}}
\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>The priors on the coefficients for each variable - “var” - are given by independent distributions: <span class="math inline">\(N(0, \sigma^2_{var})\)</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and the variance parameters are assigned a hyperprior distribution: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{var}\sim \mbox{inv-}\chi^2(\nu,\sigma^2_0)\)</span>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Here, again, the authors go to some effort to ‘sell’ the MRP approach by making explicit the notion of sparse cells borrowing strength. The idea is that if some cell has very little information then it’s coefficients will be drawn from an average of those cells that are similar.</p>
<p>After establishing whether a person is likely to vote for one of Obama or Romney, they use a very similar model to consider whether, given a person is voting for one of those two, a person is voting for Obama: <span class="math display">\[
Pr\left(Y_i = \mbox{Obama} | Y_i\in\{\mbox{Obama, Romney}\}\right) =\\
\mbox{logit}^{-1}\left(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1(\mbox{state last vote share}) 
+ \\
\alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{state}} + \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{edu}} + \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{sex}} + \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{age}}+ \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{race}}+ \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{party ID}}+\\ \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{ideology}}+ \alpha_{j[i]}^{\mbox{last vote}}
\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>All of this is run in R (R Core Team, 2019) using ‘approximate marginal maximum likelihood estimates’ via glmer() from the lme4 package (Bates, et al, 2015).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The estimate for each day is run on the basis of that day’s results as well as the previous four, hence introducing a degree of smoothing.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="state-specific-results">State-specific results</h3>
<p>They then disaggregate the national-level vote share into states (Figure <a href="#fig:figfour">7</a>). This has important considerations for the issue of importance - electoral college results. This disaggregation illustrates an important feature of MRP - that state-specific estimates can be obtained by using a state-specific post-stratification dataset. The trained model remains the same, it is only the post-stratification that changes.</p>

<h1 id="results---election-outcomes">Results - Election outcomes</h1>
<p>The survey question asked ‘if the election were held today’, which has been found to be biased in various ways. Additionally, not everyone who is able to vote actually votes. As such there is a need to translate estimates of voter intentions into estimates of election outcomes. The authors describe this as ‘calibrating’ voter intent.</p>
<p>To calibrate voter intent, they get historical data from three US presidential elections (2000, 2004, and 2008) in terms of overall national and state estimates of voter intent. They then take a moving average of the poll numbers leading up to the election. The point is to try to establish a relationship between the poll estimates and the actual outcome. The moving average of voting intent, as measured by the polls, is used as an explanatory variable for the national election day vote share of the incumbent party candidate in election year <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>:<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[y^{US}_e = a_0 + a_1x^{US}_{t,e} + a_2|x^{US}_{t,e}|x^{US}_{t,e} + a_3tx^{US}_{t,e} + \eta(t, e).\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(x^{US}_{t,e}\)</span> is the national voter intent of the incumbent party candidate <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> days before the election in year <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\eta\sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)</span> is the error term.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Both <span class="math inline">\(y^{US}_e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^{US}_{t,e}\)</span> are offset by 0.5 so that they run from -0.5 to 0.5.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The fully calibrated model is run with the gls() function in the R package nlme (Pinheiro, et al 2019).</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This paper literally changed the course of my professional life. I read it in late 2015 when I was very bored by my economics PhD. I couldn’t put it down. It seems silly now, but until then I didn’t realise that statisticians wrote papers like this, and that not only could you bring together the best aspects of politics, surveys, quantitative analysis, etc but that you could also write academic papers about it! It was the combination of everything that I was interested in. Starting in early 2016 Monica Alexander and I followed this paper and Monica implemented a version of the model in JAGS for Australia, which become: <a href="petitpoll.com">Petit Poll</a>. We gathered our own polling data by emailing friends and family and used all of this to forecast the 2016 Australian election. (We forecast the Coalition would 80-85 seats, and they eventually won 76 seats - the electoral divisions of Bass, Braddon, Lyons, and Mayo haunt my dreams.) We went on to use MRP for various other projects, improving our understanding of it and related methods. Monica was already there, but I dove further into learning R, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning, focused on applications in political science, eventually also branching out into related techniques such as text analysis. Now almost all of my work is very much statistics applied to political science, but it all started with this paper.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>One of the interesting aspects around this introduction and motivation section is that there is little discussion of the usual aspects that those who are already convinced of the MRP approach get excited about. Features such as the importance of probability distributions, and the appropriate role of uncertainty, which those of us who use MRP (and related approaches) day-to-day see as motivation, are of less concern to a broader audience. By carefully constructing the introduction and motivation section, the authors likely greatly increased the number of readers who continue through the rest of the paper.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The first use of mathematical notation does not occur until the end of the third page. This also likely helps boost the readership of this paper!<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn5"><p>It doesn’t really matter, but why was this number rounded, while the others are exact?<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>The point was raised during discussion that it would have been interesting to know the number of those who changed their mind. My experience with Australian data (as well as talking to people who are much more experienced in this area than I am) suggests there would have been very few.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

Hopefully our proposal is accepted!<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn9"><p>We’ve seen in earlier papers in this reading group that we can see echoes (that’s the wrong word; what’s the antecedent of an echo?) in much earlier work including Fay and Herriot (1979) and Little (1993) and probably a bunch of other papers. The definitive MRP history paper is probably not yet written. Lauren - are you taking submissions for MRP-fest 2021 or maybe 2022?<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Given how correlated and overlapping some of these variables seem (e.g. party ID, ideology, and 2008 vote), this discussion is not as extensive as I would like. As a reviewer of the paper, I would be interested in examining the performance of a ‘cut down’ version of the model. This would have also helped with some of the dataset issues raised later.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>1. This seems like something that could have a big effect or at least needs a lot of justification. I would have liked to have seen much more justification of this. If I were a reviewer then I would have requested they run the model using CPS and throw away whatever variables that it doesn’t have from their model. They only mention one variable, so I just can’t see why it is worth taking the hit in being so unconventional. 2. This decision also limits the capacity of others to reproduce the results. Anyone can get CPS data. But how do I get the exit poll data that they used? What exit polls did they even use? Did I miss this? The post-stratification dataset is kind of everything.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>I couldn’t work out which exit poll they used? I probably just missed a description of it, but even so, I also couldn’t see that they provide the data, which would have really helped improve the reproducibility of the paper.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>However this would be another benefit of using the CPS dataset, as it is run monthly.<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Would the authors would still use these priors or has the state-of-the-art changed?<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Again, is this what we’d still do today?<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Maybe I missed it but they don’t provide their code. This was very annoying in 2016 when Monica and I were trying to make our own version of the model. But these days it really limits the paper. Other ‘beginner-friendly’ MRP papers, such as Kastellec et al., 2016, or Hanretty, 2019, include all of their code which make them easier to assign when teaching.<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>What effect does using glmer() have on the results? I’m assuming these days this would be fit in Stan, but how easy would it be? What do we gain?<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>It wasn’t clear to me whether all of this can be run at once or do they need to run each separately? If the later, how is uncertainty being propagated between the two? Does it matter? I’m sure there are good answers here that I’m just not seeing, but I can’t see it.<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>Best I can tell each of these rolling averages for a day is run independently. Why not bring it all together?<a href="#fnref19" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>Somehow you need to bring both models to the table here, but I don’t understand whether each model is applied separately in which case what is happening to the uncertainty, or if it is possible to somehow combine it all using lme4?<a href="#fnref20" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>They show how close their results are to the actual outcome, but at the end acknowledge that this probably isn’t the best way to evaluate MRP models and discuss other aspects. What does a ‘meaningful result’ mean in the context of MRP?<a href="#fnref21" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>the point was raised during discussion that there should probably be some measure of uncertainty around these estimates.<a href="#fnref22" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>We’ve talked before about these types of graphs, and how they may be better with difference between ‘actual’ and ‘estimated’ on the y-axis, while ‘actual’ remains on the x-axis.<a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>I don’t understand what has happened to uncertainty. Those poll numbers would have had an uncertainty surrounding them, but I didn’t see a mention of this. Maybe they just used the central estimate, in which case this relationship may be overly precisely measured.<a href="#fnref24" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>I don’t understand what is happening in that <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span> coefficient, or really much of any of it. Is there a subtle difference that I’m missing? It’s the same in the states model. I understand what they are trying to do, but I don’t understand how this achieves it.<a href="#fnref25" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>I don’t understand why this is done.<a href="#fnref26" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>I’m not sure that their comparison - either here or above - is appropriate at all. By what do we evaluate an MRP model? I have thoughts on this, but am keen to develop them further.<a href="#fnref27" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>At no point is this result really all that meaningful. Is there something better that could be done here?<a href="#fnref28" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>Again, is this really how we should be analysing the success of our models? In any case, the point was raised during discussion that claiming that the mode is informative here is a little disengenious. The ‘second mode’ (is that a thing?), anyway, there’s not much different between the probability of any of the top five more likely outcomes, but they are enormously spread out.<a href="#fnref29" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>I would have liked more discussion about these aspects by which to evaluate an MRP model.<a href="#fnref30" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
