### Petit Poll

May 2016 -- *Current*

This is a joint project with [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com). Petit Poll combines non-representative polling data with a hierarchical Bayesian model to cheaply deliver meaningful Australian political polling. I am responsible for survey design and analysis, as well as marketing and communication.

We polled the 2016 Australian Federal election and got a (statistically) reasonable result. In terms of seats we were five off. Four of those were just a result of our small sample size: there were the three that turned unexpectedly in Tasmania; and the one in South Australia that went to the Nick Xenophon team. If we had more data from those areas then the model would have had a better chance, but when thereâ€™s not much data the prior has a big impact.



### Grosvenor Public Sector Advisory

Consultant,   April 2017 -- February 2019

I consulted at Grosvenor on a casual basis to complete a specific project for the European Commission relating to public procurement. This involved: identifying data sources; preparing for and supporting data acquisition; conducting data quality confirmation; helping with survey design and validation; and some minor managerial responsibilities.


### The Centre for International Economics

Economist, January 2012 -- August 2013; August 2015 -- November 2015

The CIE is a privately-owned economic consultancy. I contributed to reports for public- and private-sector clients as part of a small team. Topics included: valuing public sector outputs; housing sector taxation; the global meat market; wheat price elasticities; variations to modern awards; migration; and labor markets.


### GoCampaign

Co-founder and Director, July 2011 -- May 2015

As a co-founder and director of GoCampaign (later GoCatalyze), a data analysis tool, I was responsible for the creation and development of a business along with Andrew Barnes, Chris Eigeland and Chris Hood. There were many aspects to this including creating marketing material and websites; making pitch decks; customer on-boarding and service; presenting; market testing; and some minor managerial responsibilities. GoCatalyze completed the ANZ Innovyz START accelerator program in 2013 and won the iAward Data Category in 2014. GoCatalyze is now part of GO1. 


### Reserve Bank of Australia

Cadet/Analyst/Senior Analyst, February 2009 -- December 2011

I researched topics related to banknotes, for example an econometric analysis of banknote demand during the 2007-08 financial crisis. I was also responsible for creating and analysing counterfeit banknote datasets, and gave banknote-related presentations to the public.
