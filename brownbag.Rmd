**Overview**

In any data science project a lot of time is spent on data cleaning, preparation, and maintenance, but these steps are rarely talked about, let alone written down. This means that there is a lot of reinvention and it can be difficult to know what best practice is. To help address this [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/) and [Prof Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/) run a multidisciplinary brown bag that focuses on data cleaning. The series is a chance to share what we do in these crucial, yet little discussed, stages.

We meet for an hour roughly every week and we aim to have a roughly even split of speakers from academia and industry over the course of the term. Usually each speaker talks for 20 to 30 minutes and we then have a bit of time for questions.

Anyone is welcome to attend - you don't need to be affiliated with the university. 


**Location and time**  
We meet Fridays at noon, in Room 507, Bissell Building, 140 St George St, Toronto. If you would like to receive an occasional email about the series please [get in touch](mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca).
