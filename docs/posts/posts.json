    "description": "In this note I examine the average age of politicians in the Australian Federal Parliament on a daily basis. Using a publicly available dataset I find that generally the Senate is older than the House of Representatives. The average age increased from Federation in 1901 through to 1949, when an expansion of the parliament's size likely brought many new politicians. I am unable to explain a sustained decline that occurred during the 1970s. From the 1980s onward there has been a gradual aging of both houses.",

I recently ran a hands-on workshop at the ANU, aimed at interested, but not experienced, social scientists to help de-mystify MRP. The workshop aimed to give participants the ability and confidence to: 1) critically read papers that use it; and 2) apply it in their own work. Examples of how to implement MRP were illustrated in R using the brms package. The following post gives the outline of the workshop and the material and coding exercises covered.",
