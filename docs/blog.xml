      <title>Tidying the 2019 Kenyan Census</title>
      <dc:creator>Rohan Alexander</dc:creator>
      <link>https://rohanalexander.com/posts/2020-04-14-tidying-the-2019-kenyan-census</link>
      <description>In this note I examine the average age of politicians in the Australian Federal Parliament on a daily basis. Using a publicly available dataset I find that generally the Senate is older than the House of Representatives. The average age increased from Federation in 1901 through to 1949, when an expansion of the parliament's size likely brought many new politicians. I am unable to explain a sustained decline that occurred during the 1970s. From the 1980s onward there has been a gradual aging of both houses.</description>

      <description>This brief review of Wang, Rothschild, Goel, and Gelman, (2015) 'Forecasting elections with non-representative polls' is designed to motivate discussion during [Lauren Kennedy](https://jazzystats.com/)'s weekly MRP Discussion Group.</description>

      <title>Getting started with MRP</title>
      <dc:creator>Rohan Alexander</dc:creator>
      <link>https://rohanalexander.com/posts/2019-12-04-getting_started_with_mrp</link>
      <description>Multi-level regression with post-stratification (MRP) is a popular way to adjust non-representative samples to better analyse opinion and other survey responses. I recently ran a hands-on workshop at the ANU, aimed at interested, but not experienced, social scientists to help de-mystify MRP. The workshop aimed to give participants the ability and confidence to: 1) critically read papers that use it; and 2) apply it in their own work. Examples of how to implement MRP were illustrated in R using the brms package. The following post gives the outline of the workshop and the material and coding exercises covered.</description>

      <title>Gathering and analysing text data</title>

      <description>Text modelling is an exciting area of research. But many guides assume that you already have a nice dataset. Similarly, web scraping is an exciting way to get information, but not many explanations go on to explain what you could do with it. This post attempts to go from scraping text from a website through to modelling the topics. It's not meant to be an exhaustive post, but should hopefully provide enough that you can get started with your own project and know where to go for more information.</description>

      <title>The SQL Is Never As Good As The Original</title>
      <dc:creator>Rohan Alexander</dc:creator>
      <link>https://rohanalexander.com/posts/2018-07-28-the-sql-is-never-as-good-as-the-original</link>
      <description>SQL is a popular way of working with data. Advanced users probably do a lot with it alone, but even just having a working knowledge of SQL has increased the number of datasets that I can get data from to then analyse with other tools such as R or Python. You can use SQL within RStudio if you want. The following are a few notes to help future-Rohan when he needs to use SQL. A worked example with a sample of the Hansard data will be included in a future post.</description>

      <title>Topic Modelling - Theory</title>
      <dc:creator>Rohan Alexander</dc:creator>
      <link>https://rohanalexander.com/posts/2018-06-29-getting_started_with_topic_modelling-theory</link>
      <description>Each statement in Hansard needs to be classified by its topic. Sometimes Hansard includes titles that make the topic clear. But not every statement has a title and the titles do not always define topics in a well-defined and consistent way. One way to get consistent estimates of the topics of each statement in Hansard is to use the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method of Blei, Ng, Jordan, @Blei2003latent, as implemented by the R package 'topicmodels' by Grun @Grun2011.</description>

      <description>Eric Greitens may be the Republican Übermensch. Rhodes Scholar, Navy SEAL officer, husband and father. He's now the Republican candidate in the Missouri gubernatorial election. And one suspects that being a governor could just be a step for Greitens. While 2016 will always be the year that US politics descended to the gutter, it could also be the year that the next Republican president begins his political career.</description>

      <description>Despite many unforced errors Hillary Clinton has won the Democratic nomination and polls suggest she will beat Donald Trump. But her campaign continues to make unforced errors. There was plenty of evidence of an amateur nature to what should be a professional campaign at a recent rally for Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</description>

      <description>Donald Trump is an improved politician, but it's unlikely to be enough. He has harnessed fervent anti-Clinton sentiment amongst Republicans. But he does not have time to build the coalitions usually needed to win a US presidential election.</description>

      <title>Broader Thinking Needed on the Australian Budget</title>

      <link>https://rohanalexander.com/posts/2016-02-03-broader-thinking-needed-on-the-australian-budget</link>
      <description>The Treasury Secretary, and many others, bemoan the wasted years of the mining boom. Most agree that Australia should have more to show for what was the most significant boom since Federation. But the boom is over. And a fixation on budget surpluses means that we are missing an opportunity to make up for it. Australia’s credit rating is a strength that we should take advantage of. The Commonwealth should be borrowing to fund infrastructure investment.</description>

      <title>Notes and Photos From Iowa</title>

      <link>https://rohanalexander.com/posts/2016-01-14-notes-and-photos-from-iowa</link>
      <description>Bernie Sanders seems quite reasonable for a revolutionary. An energetic man of 74, he spoke for an hour in Perry, Iowa, to a room of 300 from only a few lines of handwritten notes, and then fielded half an hour of questions. He does not have the same aura that surrounded, then, Senator Obama in his own Iowa battle with, then, Senator Clinton in 2008 say those who saw both. Instead, Sanders has preternatural calm.</description>

      <description>Few policymakers were prepared for the financial crisis of 2007-08. Until it hit, their focus was on more obvious threats to the economy, instead of such an unexpected event. Could this be because planning for unexpected economic events is not the explicit responsibility of any particular policy-maker? If so, this has to change.</description>

      <description>The industrial relations disputes that culminated in the shutdown of Qantas last year took more than nine months to make it through arbitration. Such lengthy delays have left many wondering if changes should be made to the processes that underpin this form of dispute resolution. The use of ‘final offer’ arbitration could be the small change that has a big effect, saving conflicted parties time, money and reputation.</description>

      <description>There is broad agreement that Australian plastic bag consumption should be reduced. To this end, recent South Australian legislation has banned certain types of plastic bags. But other states wishing to reduce their plastic bag consumption may find a tax rather than a ban the more appropriate policy instrument.</description>

      <description>The Government's First Home Saver Accounts policy, announced during the last federal election, is a promise that should never have been made. It will place upward pressure upon inflation and increase the potential for domestic financial turbulence. It will be the individuals that the policy is designed to help (young Australians with a still-insecure financial foundation) that will be most hurt in the long-run.</description>
